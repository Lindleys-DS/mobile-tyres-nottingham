## What is a run-flat tyre?
Run flat tyres are designed to allow your tyre to be used for a number of miles, even after the tyre has been punctured.

The reason for this is because the tyres have been designed by having a thicker, reinforced sidewall that can hold the weight of your car without the correct amount of air pressure.

This gives you the chance to remain driving until it is safer and more appropriate to stop to have the tyre repaired or replaced.

## How long do they last for once punctured?
Run flat tyres are designed to give you the chance to continue driving with a puncture until you can reach a safe and appropriate place to arrange a replacement tyre.

They are not, however, designed to continue driving with a puncture for long periods of time or at speeds above 50mph.

On average, you’ll be able to continue on your journey whilst travelling at 30mph for another 50 miles - plenty of time to reach a safe space to give Mobile Tyres Nottingham a call!

## Can you fit regular tyres onto a run-flat originally equipped vehicle?

If your vehicle has run flat tyres as part of the original equipment, it is possible to change them to regular, conventional tyres.

However, if your car has been designed for run flat tyres, this could possibly affect the car’s handling.

## Is it possible for run-flat tyres to be repaired?

At Mobile Tyres Nottingham, we do not repair run flat tyres as whilst the tyre has been driven on whilst deflated, it could have weakened the strength of the tyre’s sidewall.
