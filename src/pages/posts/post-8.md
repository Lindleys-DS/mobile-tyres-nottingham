Did you know it’s the Summer months that have more tyre-related incidents than any other season?

TyreSafe have launched a campaign with a cautionary reminder to motorists that it’s the summer months when there are more tyre-related incidents reported than any other.

TyreSafe is a UK charity completely dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of correct tyre maintenance and the dangers of defective and illegal tyres.

They work closely with a wide range of commercial and government organisations such as the Highways England, RoadSafe, police forces, fire services, councils and many other bodies.

Since its inception, TyreSafe’s activities have helped reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured each year in a tyre related accident by 46%.

It has been reported by TyreSafe that July has the most tyre-related incidents, closely followed by August and then June.

On average, across all road types in Great Britain, August is the busiest month, with some of the popular tourist routes through the countryside increasing by 25%.

Stuart Jackson, Chairman, TyreSafe said: “A combination of factors come together to make the summer months the worst for reported tyre-related incidents. Summer in Britain doesn’t necessarily mean consistently good weather and the variations in road conditions may well be catching out unsuspecting drivers.

“When drivers take to the busier roads, they may be travelling longer distances than they normally would in fully laden cars, which puts their tyres under extra stress. Under these conditions, an under inflated tyre, or one with a defect, is more vulnerable to damage and potentially catastrophic failure. It really is vital that all drivers check their tyres are in good roadworthy condition to minimise the risk of an unwanted disruption to their summer get-away.”

Mobile Tyres Nottingham recommend that before you embark on any long journey you start with a visual check of all your tyres including the spare, looking at the overall condition of each tyre to see if anything might have penetrated the tread, such as nails or other objects. If any of these objects, cracks or bulges are present, please give us a call 01157270767.

You should also check the air pressure of each tyre using an accurate gauge. Vehicle manufacturers recommend two different tyre pressures, one for light loads and another for when the vehicle is full.

It’s essential that you adjust the pressures to accommodate the load you’re carrying. These settings can be found in the vehicle handbook, on reputable internet tyre pressure charts such as the one at www.tyresafe.org, and often in the vehicle’s fuel filler cap or door sill.

Aswell as the safety aspect, these simple checks could save you the cost of an average tank of fuel because under inflated tyres wear more quickly and increase fuel consumption.

Finally, checks should be made for the tread of their tyres to ensure they are above the UK legal limit of 1.6mm.

Ideally an accurate tread depth gauge should be used but if this is not available, a 20p coin can be used as a guide. Insert the 20p into the main sections of the tyre and at various points around the circumference – should you see the outer rim at any point, you need new tyres ASAP.

Enjoy the beautiful summer weather (Hopefully!) and drive safe!
